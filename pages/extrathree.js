        Hi Baby, <br /> <br />
        There have been a lot of ups and downs in our relationship, just like every other relationship. But we have come a long way, right? We both had our issues and even after seeing the worst days we didn&apos;t give up on each other. I&apos;m proud of us for where we are now. I can&apos;t imagine how my life would have been if you were not in it. Even though when we were in the rough patches of this road, you pulled me up. Sometimes I didn&apos;t realise it at that time.
        <br /> <br/>
        I just want to let you know that I appreciate you and our relationship. Thank you for being my solace. Thank you for bearing with me instead of giving up. Thank you for not stopping to love me or believing in me.
        <br /> <br />
        I know that there will be challenges ahead too, but I have faith that we can overcome them together. You are my rock and I trust you with all my heart. Always remember that it&apos;s not you against me, it&apos;s our team against the problem. I can&apos;t wait to see what the future holds for us.<br /> <br />
        Yours Pengu ♥️
