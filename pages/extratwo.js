        Hi Baby, <br /> <br />
        Our shared passion for travelling is basically how we first found chemistry together. You told me about your previous trip stories and adventures. And I used to think that this sounds so much fun. I also want to go with him. And how you talked about food and cooking. I thought wow he likes to cook food too. Could he be any more perfect? Just like I told you &apos; You&apos;re the novel vla ldka for me&apos;. 
        <br /> <br/>
        And not too much time after that we started going on these trips together. I thank god for that I have a partner who won&apos;t ever say no to a little outing when we get trapped in this cycle of work and party. Although we both like to plan trips we both agree on so many things. Because of you, I have had so many new experiences. Our first trip to Vizag was so perfectly planned. Even though we spoiled it a little by fighting. But even then I have good pictures of it in my head. And my favourite small trip - Mysore.  
        <br /> <br />
        But after that, my life feels like a fairytale. Because I can experience whatever the hell I want with you by my side. I thought that after some time we would be bored of going alone without friends. But I am lucky that you love me enough. That I am always enough for you. And even for me, it&apos;s most convenient when it&apos;s just the two of us. And for that, I will always keep trying to take not bad pictures of you everywhere we go.
        I could ever ask for. I love you more than words can express. <br /> <br />
        Yours Pengu ♥️
